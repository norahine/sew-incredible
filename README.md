# Sew Incredible

Sew Incredible is a hobby project that I created to learn Ruby on Rails. It allows you to create, edit, and store fashion instructions/blueprints in an organized way.

It uses devise for authentication, and each user manages his own set of blueprints.

I wanted to learn how to use mailers, so I also added a contact form.

It was also important for me to learn how internationalization works in Rails, so I used Rails' I18n features to ensure that the site works in both English and Polish.

Take a look! If you have an idea for a new feature, or find a bug, please create an issue!

You can see a [live demo of the app here](http://sew-incredible.herokuapp.com).
